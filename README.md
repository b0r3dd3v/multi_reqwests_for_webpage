# multi_reqwests_for_webpage
Multi Reqwest is a windows console app written in Rust and its intended to bombard a web server with requests for a certain webpage and test how long it takes the server to service all requests and to check the limit of requests that server can take.

Using it is rather simple: 1. start aplication 2. introduce number of requests u want to try 3. introduce the web address or localhost address u want to test 4. choose to see information about requests success, failure, or errors ( choosing no info speeds up the duration of the all tasks by 1/3) 5. enjoy the app bombarding the target server as fast posible and in a multitreaded fashion. 6 see how many requests succeded with code 200, failed with other codes or errored cause of connections issues, server not responding, etc... and most important check how long it took.

This app was written in Rust programming language and was made with crossbeam and reqwest crates (a big tnx to the authors of the crates and to the lovelly Rust comunity). The app for now is just contained in a main.rs because the app is rather small but in the future I intend to move code into main.rs and lib.rs in the Rust idiomatic way. The app runs pages reqwest tasks on ass many threads as the number of requests chosen by the users, but asking the operating system to allocate resource for new threads is also time consuming and if the app would use a smaller number of threads and reuse some of the threads that finished the job it could gain a good speed up I believe, but for now that something is planed in a future versions of the app. For now this app can request 1000 times the same page in 0,5 secs on a my intel i5 8300h laptop processor running also a simple webpage on a LAMP server.
